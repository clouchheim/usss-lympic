"""One pass through the Lympik -> Teamworks AMS pipeline (steps 1-7).

Scheduling/interval is left to whatever runs this script (cron, a scheduled
task, etc.) -- this module is a single run.

Duplicate protection: before uploading, run() asks Teamworks itself which
(Lympik event, Teamworks athlete) pairs already have a "Lympik Event" entry,
via TeamworksClient.find_existing_event_ids() (POST /api/v1/synchronise,
matching our own "Event ID" row-0 field against the event ids this run is
about to process). This replaced an earlier local JSON ledger stopgap --
querying Teamworks directly means no local state file to lose or fall out
of sync, and it also sees entries created any other way (a manual entry, a
different script). See PIPELINE.md for why the ledger existed and how this
replaced it, and docs/teamworks-api-reference.md for the endpoint itself.
Since this endpoint's response shape isn't yet confirmed against this
specific AMS instance, every call dumps its raw response to
debug_payloads/synchronise_response.json for verification.
